    <p>
        This project showcases a real-time embedded medical monitoring system developed on an ESP32 microcontroller. The device continuously measures two critical patient-related signals: a potentiometer simulating medication dosage levels and an LDR sensor modeling patient reaction or distress. Both sensors are managed under strict 100 ms hard real-time deadlines using FreeRTOS to ensure no readings are missed, even under heavy system load.

        When abnormal values are detected, the system raises immediate LED-based alerts and prints timestamped warnings through the serial console, demonstrating deterministic and traceable behavior. In addition, a hardware button triggers an interrupt service routine (ISR), simulating an emergency nurse request that bypasses regular scheduling to guarantee an instant response.

        Together, these components form a reliable medical-alert prototype that highlights the importance of real-time constraints, interrupt handling, and concurrent task scheduling in life-critical embedded systems.
