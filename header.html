        <p>
            This project demonstrates a real-time embedded medical monitoring system built using an ESP32. 
            The device continuously reads two patient-related sensor inputs: a medication-level potentiometer 
            and an LDR-based patient reaction sensor. Both run under hard real-time deadlines using FreeRTOS. 
            A button interrupt simulates a nurse emergency request. Alerts are handled through LED signals and 
            timestamped serial output to prove deterministic timing.
